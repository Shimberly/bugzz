# SABERTOOTH - The survivor
Prototype idea of a videogame made in Phaser (JS) for the Game Off 2021 (itch.io)

GAME: 
(MOVE, EAT & SURVIVE)
You become a baby beetle that have to eat leaves for evolve while you dodge the enemies around you. Once you eat enought leaves you can escape through a tunnel.

This is the first phase/the beginning of an amazing game. This phase is meant to be for the Game Off 2021 for itch.io.
I will continue updating, adding levels and difficulties to the game in order to become an incredible bugs dungeon!!!
Keep in touch if you want to follow the game :)

BRANCHES:
The 'main' one is made with server included node.js and express and it shows directly in Heroku.
This is for my personal use and to practice my backend skills.
Heroku: https://bugzz.herokuapp.com/

The branch named 'gameoff2021' its the one uploaded for the Game Jam for itch.io. This has no server and its pure HTML and Javascript with Phaser.
